\section{What is H2O?}
\Urlmuskip=0mu plus 1mu\relax %needed to make long URLs break nicely


H2O is fast, scalable, open-source machine learning and deep learning for smarter applications. With H2O, enterprises like PayPal, Nielsen Catalina, Cisco, and others can use all their data without sampling to get accurate predictions faster. Advanced algorithms such as deep learning, boosting, and bagging ensembles are built-in to help application designers create smarter applications through elegant APIs. Some of our initial customers have built powerful domain-specific predictive engines for recommendations, customer churn, propensity to buy, dynamic pricing, and fraud detection for the insurance, healthcare, telecommunications, ad tech, retail, and payment systems industries.

Using in-memory compression, H2O handles billions of data rows in-memory, even with a small cluster. To make it easier for non-engineers to create complete analytic workflows, H2O's platform includes interfaces for R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON, and CoffeeScript/JavaScript, as well as a built-in  web interface, Flow. H2O is designed to run in standalone mode, on Hadoop, or within a Spark Cluster, and typically deploys within minutes.

H2O includes many common machine learning algorithms, such as generalized linear modeling (linear regression, logistic regression, etc.), Na\"{i}ve Bayes, principal components analysis, k-means clustering, and others. H2O also implements best-in-class algorithms at scale, such as distributed random forest, gradient boosting, and deep learning. Customers can build thousands of models and compare the results to get the best predictions.

H2O is nurturing a grassroots movement of physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists to herald the new wave of discovery with data science by collaborating closely with academic researchers and industrial data scientists. Stanford university giants Stephen Boyd, Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani advise the H2O team on building scalable machine learning algorithms. With hundreds of meetups over the past three years, H2O has become a word-of-mouth phenomenon, growing amongst the data community by a hundred-fold, and is now used by 30,000+ users and is deployed using R, Python, Hadoop, and Spark in 2000+ corporations.
