== How to run
Example:

 $ python main.py -i 127.0.0.1 -p 54321 -f exp.yaml -e /tmp -j journal

== How to create an experiment

In python:

[source, python]
----
include::examples/exp1.py[]
----

Or in YAML:

[source, yaml]
----
include::examples/exp1.yaml[]

=== Warning

Various models implement different parameters used to determine whether it is a regression or classification model.
Usually this parameter is called `distribution` and it's values are `binomial` or `multinomial` depending on the number
of response classes (two or more respectively). However there are models that use different parameter that means basically
the same (in this sense) such as GLM that uses family parameter.

===== Models that use `distribution` parameter
* Deeplearning
* Gradient Boosting model

===== Models that use `family` paramter
* Generalized linear model
