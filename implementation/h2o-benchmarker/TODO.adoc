= TODO

== Plot
* Beautify labels [in progress]
* add more info to README


== Data preprocessing
* Fix `h2o.import_file(na_strings=[])` in `experiment.py`
* Handle case in which sample of train/validation/test data has less than 20 rows (LOW PRIORITY, unlikely to happen with larger data sets)
